## Introduction
ROS2 is a powerful middleware framework that has been developed from the ground up with Data Distrubted Services (DDS) to perform communications between different aspects of your ROS2 framework. It provides a replacement to the traditional ROS1 pub/sub framework, which was developed in house. The benefits, plan and design of this are described [here](https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros_on_dds.html).

PX4 is an open-source autopilot framework for development and deployment of different vehicles. It supports vehicles such as quadrotors, fixed wing aircraft, surface rovers, ROV's and USVs. 

The main motivation of this blog post is to provide a reference or guide as to my setup of PX4 and ROS2 for development of multi-agent robotic enviornments, planners and simulations for my research. I hope this can serve as a guide for those in similar fields. Or at least, it will serve as a reference for me when I inevvitbly break my Ubuntu install and need to re-install everything ;)

## ROS2 
Installing ROS2 is fairly straightforward. You can follow the official documentation [Here](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html). I work mainly with Galactic. If you are using Foxy it might be easier, as PX4 uses eProsima's Fast DDS implementation. 

To get PX4 working with ROS2 Galactic, we need to install and configure Fast DDS. 

Make sure you have rosdep installed, then:
```
sudo apt install ros-galactic-rmw-fastrtps-cpp
```

```
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp
```

You can test it out with:
Terminal 1:
```
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
```

Terminal 2: 
```
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
```

## PX4
PX4 install is a bit more involved.

### PX4 Base
To install PX4, you can create a directory in home.

```
mkdir ~/px4
```

Then clone the repo, insuring you have the recursive flag

```
git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
```

Run the ubuntu setup bash file.

```
bash ./PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh
```

### Gradle
I find the best way to install gradle is with SDK
[Install SDK](https://sdkman.io/install)

```
sdk install gradle 6.3
```

### FastRTPSGen

Install FastRTPSGen, this is not the same as FastDDS. 

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS-Gen.git -b v1.0.4 ~/Fast-RTPS-Gen \
    && cd ~/Fast-RTPS-Gen \
    && gradle assemble \
    && sudo env "PATH=$PATH" gradle install
```

If you get errors regarding openJDK versions, change the version that is installed in 
`PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh` from version 13 to version 11, and rerun the script (ubuntu.sh) in the PX4 Base install section above. 

### QGroundControl
This is the ground control software. You can simply download the appimage. I download them into a folder called `~/app_images`

[Link](http://qgroundcontrol.com/). 
Right click the file, and click "permissions", allow it to run as an application. 

## px4_ros_com and px4_msgs
There are two packages when working with the microRTPS bridge (the PX4 ROS2 bridge) that are useful. You can create a overlay workspace with them

```
mkdir ~/px4_ros
cd px4_ros
mkdir src
git clone https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com
git clone https:://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs
cd ..
colcon build
```

**Note, close the terminal you did colcon build in, otherwise, especially before sourcing the overlay workspace, otherwise, it may cause issues**


## Testing
There are a few different ways to make sure that you have everything setup. 

### Single Agent
First, you can confirm the microRTPS bridge is working using a single-agent.

```
cd ~/px4
make px4_sitl_rtps gazebo_plane
```

In a new terminal
```
`cd ~/app_images/`
./QGroundControl.appimage
```

In another terminal
```
source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash
cd ~/px4_ros
source ./install/setup.bash
micrortps_agent -t UDP
```

In another terminal
```
source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash
cd ~/px4_ros
source ./install/setup.bash
ros2 topic list
```

You should see topics related to PX4. 

### Multi Agent 
To test multi-agent (which is the real benefit of DDS), we can do the following.

**Terminal 1**
```
cd ~/px4/PX4-Autopilot/
git submodule update --init --recursive
DONT_RUN=1 make px4_sitl_rtps gazebo
```

Wait to finish

```
./Tools/gazebo_sitl_multiple_run.sh -t px4_sitl_rtps -m iris -n 2
```
This runs a script which spawns 2 iris drones

**Terminal 2**
Run micrortps agent with parameters

```
cd ~/px4_ros_com_ros2
source ./install/setup.bash
micrortps_agent -t UDP -r 2020 -s 2019 -n vhcl0 & micrortps_agent -t UDP -r 2022 -s 2021 -n vhcl1
```

(this is one line)
It specifies the connection to heach vehicle, the recieving UDP port (-r) and the transmitting UDP port (-t). Each vehicle is allocated a unique MAVLink system id (vhcl0, vhcl1...).  

**Terminal 3**
```
cd ~/px4_ros_com_ros2
source ./install/setup.bash
ros2 topic list
```

**NOTE**: When done, always completly close terminal 2. If you get errors relating to blocked UDP ports, or ports already in use, try `killall micrortps*`, to kill any remaining micrortps processes, and try again.

## Conclusion
Hopefully, this tutorial provides you with the necessary reqsources to get your development environment up and running. PX4 is a bit confusing at times, and ROS2 errors are hard to diagnose as well.
